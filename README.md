Registration and Login System
Project Description
The Registration and Login System is a simple PHP-based web application that allows users to register, log in, and search for existing users. This project demonstrates the use of PHP for session handling, form submission, and basic database interaction.

Features
User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing an ID, username, password, gender, and date of birth. It checks for duplicate usernames before inserting a new user into the database.
User Login: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
User Search: Users can search for other users by entering their username, and the application will display the details of the found user (ID, name, gender, and date of birth).
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML forms for user interaction (registration, login, and search)
Backend: PHP (for handling form submissions, user registration, login, and search)
Database: MySQL (for storing user details)
Web Server: XAMPP or any similar PHP-supported web server
